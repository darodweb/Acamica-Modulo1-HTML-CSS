#Acamica Full Stack Developer Bootcamp

Acamica is a web development academy based in Argentina with presence in several other countries in Latin America.

I created this repository to document my journey through Acamica's Full Stack Web Development 7-month course. Although I have always been shy towards making public the initial projects and "baby steps" that one takes when starting out in this area, I consider it useful and motivational as it allows one to document progress and identify areas of improvement.
